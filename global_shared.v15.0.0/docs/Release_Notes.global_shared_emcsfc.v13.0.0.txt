Implementation information

Compute resources (mandatory):
  - There are two J-jobs associated with this implementation:  
    - /gfs.v13.0.0/jobs/JGFS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP
    - /gdas.v13.0.0/jobs/JGDAS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP
  - Both jobs run serially and use 2 Gb memory.
  - JGFS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP runs in 90 seconds.   
  - JGDAS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP runs in two minutes.
  - Recommended lsf commands for running J-jobs on WCOSS:
     #BSUB -R rusage[mem=2000]
     #BSUB -R affinity[core]
     #BSUB -W 0:03
  - 128 Mb disk space per day required for output snow and ice files.
  - Run every six hours as part of GFS/GDAS cycles.
  - Libraries used:  BACIO.v2.0.1; W3NCO.v2.0.6; G2.v2.5.0; IP.v2.0.0; SP.v2.0.2; LANDSFCUTIL.v2.0.0.
  - Compiler:  Intel Fortran v12.1
  - Data retention for files in /com under prod/para/test environments:  Same as current GFS/GDAS OPS. 

Pre-implementation testing requirements:
  - Should be tested as part of FY16 GFS package.
  - 30-day evaluation required.
  - Evaluators: same as those for FY16 GFS package.

Dissemination info:
  - Output snow and ice files have no external users. 
  - All snow and ice files reside in /com and should be transferred from PROD WCOSS to DEV WCOSS

HPSS Archive:
  - Retention length: same as current GFS/GDAS OPS /com data.
  - Five output files to be archived: 
     (1) gdas1.t${cc}.seaice.5min.blend.grb
     (2) gdas1.t${cc}.snogrib_t1534.3072.1536
     (3) gdas1.t${cc}.snogrib_t574.1152.576
     (4) gfs.t${cc}.snogrib_t1534.3072.1536
     (5) gfs.t${cc}.seaice.5min.blend.grb

Implementation Instructions:
  - cd to appropriate /nw${envir}
  - Checkout code from subversion:  svn checkout https://svnemc.ncep.noaa.gov/projects/gfs/tags/global_shared.v13.0.0
  - Build emcsfc_snow2mdl program:  See README.build file in /sorc/emcsfc_snow2mdl.fd directory for details.
  - Build emcsfc_ice_blend program:  See README.build file in /sorc/emcsfc_ice_blend.fd for details.
  - Both programs may be built with the /sorc/build_emcsfc.sh driver build script.

Job Dependencies:
  - JGDAS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP may be run after the obsproc_global.v2.1.1/JGDAS_DUMP job copies the IMS, AFWA, and 
    5-minute MMAB data to /com.  JGDAS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP does not need to wait until obsproc_global.v2.1.1/JGDAS_DUMP
    completes, and it may be run concurrently obsproc_global.v2.1.1/JGDAS_PREP.  JGDAS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP must finish
    before these three jobs can start:
      (1) /gdas.v13.0.0/jobs/JGDAS_ANALYSIS_HIGH
      (2) /gdas.v13.0.0/jobs/JGDAS_ENKF_INNOVATE_OBS
      (3) /gdas.v13.0.0/jobs/JGDAS_ENKF_SELECT_OBS
  - JGFS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP may be run after the obsproc_global.v2.1.1/JGFS_DUMP job copies the IMS, AFWA, and 
    5-minute MMAB data to /com.  It may be run concurrently with obsproc_global.v2.1.1/JGFS_PREP.  
    JGFS_EMCSFC_SFC_PREP must finish before the following job can start:
      (1) /gfs.v13.0.0/jobs/JGFS_ANALYSIS
