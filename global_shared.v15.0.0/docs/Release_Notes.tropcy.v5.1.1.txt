tropcy_qc_reloc.v5.1.1
     ----- (last modified August 10, 2015)

  tropcy_qc_reloc.v5.1.1 directory currently includes hurricane related 
scripts/code for GFS/GDAS. There are three main functionalities in the 
scripts/code:

  1) global TC vital data collection and data quality control
  2) tropical storm relocation
  3) TC tracker for application in GFS relocation and GFS post jobs

  The scripts/code are upgrades from the tropcy_qc_reloc 5.0.1, and have the flexibility 
to do hourly relocation and 3-hourly relocation. The tropcy_qc_reloc 5.1.1 includes the 
following changes:

 1) remove the TC vitals marked as (WV, ET or LO) from storm relocation (and
storm bogus data creation)
 2) combine hourly relocation with 3-hourly relocation.
 3) unify the build.sh (named as ubuild.sh) for different machines (WCOSS, Zeus and others).

RESOURCE INFORMATION
 * Current operational JGDAS_TROPCY_QC_RELOC/JGFS_TROPCY_QC_RELOC are on WCOSS phase1 nodes. Q1FY16 GFS package
 * should be implemented on WCOSS phase2 nodes.
 * job configuration
      * current operations:  3 nodes, 16 tasks, ptile=1, 16 threads
      * proposed package:  7 nodes, 32 tasks, ptile=1, 32 threads
   * run time
      * current operations:  roughly 5 minutes
      * proposed package:  same run time

There are two J-Jobs Exporting same MP_XXX environment variables:

 export OMP_NUM_THREADS=32
 export MP_LABELIO=yes
 export MP_MPILIB=mpich2
 export MP_EUILIB=us
 export MP_TASK_AFFINITY=cpu:32
 export MP_USE_BULK_XFER=yes
 export MP_STDOUTMODE=unordered
 export MPICH_ALLTOALL_THROTTLE=0
 export MP_COREFILE_FORMAT=core.txt
 export OMP_STACKSIZE=3G
 export MP_COMPILER=intel

1. Code Changes:

   1) relocation code is upgraded to handle both hourly relocation and 3-hourly relocation
   2) tracker code is upgraded to output hourly storm positions for hurricane relocation.  This is accomplished in subroutine output_all and utilizes a namelist variable called atcffreq to determine if output is hourly or 3-hourly.

2. Forecast Job Changes:

   FORECAST Jobs are updated (small changes):

   JGDAS_TROPCY_QC_RELOC
   JGFS_TROPCY_QC_RELOC
   JNAM_TROPCY_QC_RELOC
   JNDAS_TROPCY_QC  
   JNDAS_TROPCY_RELOC
   JGFS_CYCLONE_TRACKER

3. Job script changes:

   No changes to the job scripts:

     extropcy_qc_reloc.sh.ecf

4. USH script changes:

   The following scripts are changed:
 
   tropcy_relocate.sh
   tropcy_relocate_extrkr.sh
   syndat_qctropcy.sh
   getges.sh
   global_extrkr.sh -- Most of the changes to this script were to ensure 
   compliance with new variable name standards for phase-2 compatibility.
   However, one substantial change that was made was to include scripting
   code to create the appropriate storm ID directory under ATCFdir if the
   directory does not already exist.

5. Fix file changes:

   gdas.tracker_leadtimes_hrly    <== new
   syndat_stmnames                <== no change
   syndat_fildef.vit              <== no change
   gfs_hgt_levs.txt               <== no change 
   gfs_tmp_levs.txt               <== no change
   syndat_slmask.t126.gaussian    <== no changes
   gdas.tracker_leadtimes         <== no change
   NOTE: For the JGFS_CYCLONE_TRACKER job in the GFS post-processing, 
   the "tracker_leadtimes" file is not pulled from a fix file / fix 
   directory.  Instead, that tracker_leadtimes file is created on the 
   fly from within the global_extrkr.sh script.
