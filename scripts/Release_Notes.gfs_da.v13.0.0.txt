RESOURCE INFORMATION
 * Current operational GFS runs on WCOSS phase1 nodes.   Q1FY16 GFS package should be implemented on WCOSS phase2 nodes.
 * JGFS_ANALYSIS
   * job configuration
      * current operations:  120 nodes, 480 tasks, ptile=4, 4 threads
      * proposed package:  240 nodes, 480 tasks, ptile=2, 12 threads
   * run time
      * current operations:  20.4 - 21.4 minutes
      * proposed package:  22 - 23 minutes
        NOTE1: see ../driver/test_gfs_analysis.sh for job specific module load and environment variable settings
        NOTE2: Run time can be reduced to ~20 minutes by reducing number of second outer loop iterations to ~130.
               Reducing the number of iterations alters the anlaysis result.  As such, the EMC DA team must be 
               consulted before making any change to the number of iterations.
 * Disk space required per day
   * /com/gfs/prod/gfs.$PDY
      * current operations:  2221.0 Gb
      * proposed package:  2329.5 Gb (additional 108.5 Gb)
   * frequency of run
   * 6 hourly cycle (00, 06, 12, 18Z)
 * Specify all versions of libs, compilers, shared code being used
   * gfs_da.v13.0.0 only contains jobs/JGFS_ANALYSIS.  No libraries or compilers are required to install gfs_da.v13.0.0
   * modules loaded during GSI run
      * ics/15.0.3
      * ibmpe/1.3.0.10
      * lsf/9.1
 * Data retention for files in /com and /nwges under prod/para/test environments
   * same as current operations
