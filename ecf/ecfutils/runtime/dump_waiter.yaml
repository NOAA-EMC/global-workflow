  manual: |
    The dump_waiter task is a special job needed to run this
    workflow outside of the production suite.  It handles the
    external dependency on the dump and the associated
    (approximate) time dependency.
    In ecflow:
      The dump_waiter is started when the cycle is allowed to
      begin, and waits for the dump to be available.  It sets
      the "updated_status" event when the dump is available.
    In Rocoto:
      The dump_waiter is never run; it is defined so that the
      updated_status data event can be used as a data dependency
      in the prep job.
