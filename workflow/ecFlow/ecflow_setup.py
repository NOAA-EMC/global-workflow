class Ecflowsetup:
    """
    This class pulls in the configurations from the ecflow config file. Then
    it calls the ecflow_definitions.py module to create a suite definition
    from each of the suites in the YAML file. Then each of the edits, tasks,
    triggers, etc. are processed and added to the suite.

    All suites are then put together as part of a definition file and finally
    that file is saved.

    Attributes
    ----------
    suite_array : dict
        A dictionary that contains ecflow.Suite objects provided by the ecflow
        module.
    DEFS : ecflow.Defs
        A definition object provided by the ecflow module that holds all of the
        suites.

    Methods
    -------
    generate_workflow()
        This is the main method, used to setup the suites from the YAML file and
        then call each of the supporting methods, like edits, tasks, etc. to
        populate the suites with each of the items.

    raiseexception(e)
        This is just a simple method that is called if an exception is raised to
        print out the error message and then call a sys.exit(1) so the app stops

    save()
        This saves the suite definition file to the save dir with the file name
        ecflow_suite.def.

    print()
        Prints out what would be populated to the suite definition file.

    add_environment_edits(suite)
        The suite is passed in and the edits from the environment are added. The
        environment edits are defined in the init method.

    check_dict(node, key, key_is_dict=True)
        This function checks for the presence of they key inside of the node.
        Used to identify it various addons need to be added into the suite.

    add_suite_edits(suite, suite_dict)
        Method used to parse through the YAML file and identify any edits that
        apply to the suite itself and parse them so they can be added.

    process_definition_header()
        If there is an externs section in the YAML file for a suite, this adds
        the externs to the header.

    add_families(suite, nodes, parents=None)
        Parses through the YAML file contents and adds the nodes that are
        identified as families to either the parent suite or the parent family.

    add_tasks_and_edits(suite,nodes,parents=None)
        After the families are added to the suite, the individual tasks, edits,
        repeats, defstatus, and room for other task addons are appended.

    add_triggers_and_events(suite, nodes)
        After the families and tasks are added, then the triggers and events
        are processed. This needs to come after the families and tasks and
        independently because of the interdependencies that exist. For example
        a trigger for a task cannot be added until the task exists, otherwise
        and error will be thrown.
