## This case file is intended to be modified by the user (you) to run
## any arbitrary case that pulls data off of the NOAA HPSS tape
## archiving system.  Obviously, you need access to HPSS to use this
## script.  If you cannot access HPSS, then you will have to use a staged data case.  

## Follow the instructions below to modify the configuration.

case:
  fv3_settings:
    # Set the resolution here, in the "CASE" option.  Fully tested
    # resolutions are C192, C384, and C768.
    CASE: C768

    # LEVS: Number of vertical levels.  Do not change.  In this
    # release, only 65 vertical levels have been tested.
    LEVS: 65

    # NOTE: You can configure physics, dynamics, and other model
    # settings here.  However, that is not supported.  See
    # schema/fv3.yaml for options.

  gfs_output_settings:
    # Set the GFS output times here.  The output times are:
    #
    #   0             to  FHMAX_HF_GFS  stepping by  FHOUT_HF_GFS
    #   FHMAX_HF_GFS  to  FHMAX_GFS     stepping by  FHOUT_GFS
    #
    # The high- and low-frequency output times contain the same
    # variables at the same resolution.  To disable the high-frequency
    # output time period and only output at one frequency, remove the
    # FHMAX_HF_GFS and FHOUT_HF_GFS variables.
    FHMAX_GFS: 168
    FHOUT_GFS: 6
    FHMAX_HF_GFS: 48
    FHOUT_HF_GFS: 3

  settings:
    # SDATE: The initial time in an ISO 8601 date format with both day and time:
    SDATE: 2017-08-22t00:00:00

    # EDATE: Initial time of the last cycle. Here we set it to the 
    # initial time of the first cycle so that we only run one cycle.
    # You can run more than one cycle by setting this to a time after
    # SDATE.  The difference between EDATE and SDATE must be a multiple
    # of six hours.  The public release has only been tested with EDATE=SDATE
    EDATE: !calc SDATE

    # run_gsi: Do not run data assimilation (its scripts and code are missing)
    run_gsi: No

    # chgres_and_convert_ics: Convert GSM GFS analysis files to FV3.  This is
    # turned off in the staged data cases because they are using FV3 input
    # files instead.
    chgres_and_convert_ics: yes

    # gfs_cyc: this setting is used in a full data assimilation cycled
    # workflow to only run the GFS every N cycles.  Keep this at "4" to
    # ensure it is run every cycle.  
    gfs_cyc: 4

  places:
    # workflow_file: which workflow we're running.  This specifies the
    # jobs to run and their dependencies.  The only workflow included
    # in this release is the public release workflow.
