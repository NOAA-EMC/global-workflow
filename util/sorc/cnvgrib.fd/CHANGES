cnvgrib-1.0   - August 2003 - Original version

cnvgrib-1.0.1 - October 2003 - Corrected error converting level info for
                               "depth below land surface" from GRIB1 to GRIB2.
                             - Removed statement that set GRIB1 local table
                               version to "2".

cnvgrib-1.0.2 - May 2004 - Changed Master Table Version Number from 1 to the
                           current "operational" value of 2, when converting
                           from GRIB1 to GRIB2. 
                         - Added support for Gaussian grids.
                         - Few minor bug fixes relating to:
                            1) ensemble params 191 and 192 (grib1 table ver 2)
                            2) negative pv surface values
                            3) radius of earth
                            4) # of missing values in PDS/PDT

cnvgrib-1.1.0 - January 2005 - WMO approved the JPEG2000 and PNG Data 
                               Representation Templates ( 5.40000 and 5.40010,
                               respectively ) for operational use.  The 
                               templates were assigned WMO values of 5.40 and 
                               5.41, respectively.  Changes were made to the 
                               source and to acceptable program options to 
                               recognize either template number.
                             - Added new option "-m" to support encoding of 
                               "Missing" data values within the data field when
                               using Data Representation Templates 5.2 
                               (option -p2) and 5.3 (options -p31 and -p32 ).
                               Missing value management is an alternative to
                               encoding a bitmap when using DRTs 5.2 and 5.3.
                             - Fixed bug passing null pointers to routines
                               expecting a valid target.  Thanks to Jaakko
                               Hyvatti and Portland Group.
                             - Added fix for bug that caused seg faults on some
                               systems when generating GRIB1 messages.  Thanks 
                               to Robert Shectman for this one.

                          - Fixed complex endcoding - single-value fields or almost-single-value (ie:1.000-1.001)
                            will lead to crash or invalid data when using complex encoding.
                          - Fixed the use of alog(real(value)+1)/alog(2) in encoding is leading to precision issues.
                            Replaced this with an integer implementation that is completely accurate.
                          - Code assumes masked fields have at least one point turned on.  If all points are masked out,
                            the code will crash or produce a bad grib record once in a while. These fixes are for simple
                            coding and complex coding.
