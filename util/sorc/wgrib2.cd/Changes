		new: 264:30420217:d=2004021912:TMIN:2 m above ground:66-72 hour fcst:

		    wrong, used 2's complement to store integer rather than signed number.
		    NCEP operations knows of the problem but can't fix it because of 
		    downstream software.
		changed -prob: prob>N to prob >N, prob<N prob <N, prob>N <N to prob =N
		-lev0 .. handle factions of a PV unit in control file
v0.1.7.8c  1/2009 (internal)

                      fprintf(inv_file,"%s", item_deliminator);
                changed grid_id.c to grid_ident.c because of MacOS problems 
			(grid_id.c == Grid_id.c)
		minor bug fix in g2clib
                updated version from 1.9.7-beta to 1.9.7a

				2 -> g2clib
                added USE_G2CLIB, include/exclude g2clib decoders (still uses 2 small routines 
		   from g2clib) result of changes: g2clib decoders are not used for decoding 
                   unless enabled In the future, g2clib decoders will be eliminated from the
		   default configuration. (Needed for the debug configurations.)
		added -wind_dir
		minor edit of set_ts_dates (HEADER line) and error message string
		add rand to RPN.n returns uncorrelated random number field 0 to 1
		fixed OpenMP for unpk_complex.c, some optimization of unpk_complex
		removed OpenMP from iplib.2012. Never had a problem but C->fortran
		  is already a problem.  Why add a complication?

			and -disc (alias to previous options). All other codes used a macro
			which was correct
		update year code on Changes file
		updated makefile for new version of netcdf4
		fixed Ext_name.c for code table 4.3: added prob fcst, climatological thanks Manfred Schwarb
		added various Gaussian grids to ncep_grids.c
		better error message, f_g2clib
		can turn off png and jpeg2000 support by makefile
		 if turn off png, jasper, proj4, netcdf3 and netcdf4, no external 
		 libraries that need to be configured.  good for cross-compiling.
		0xSec fixed section number output for mode >= 2
		added lambertc grid defn for -new_grid: new_grid_lambertc, modified New_grid.c
		added radius_major and radius_minor to struct local in New_grid.c, so lambertc

		   reported by NCAR.
		major changes to -merge_fcst: supports ensembles, many changes, old code had
		    problems
		wind_speed, wind_dir: old: failed if mastertab > 6, now works for all mastertab != 255
		    ie local table      
		Grads.c: f_ctl_inv, change probability numbers to keep trailing zeros  3 and 30 were
		  causing grads variable name to be aliased .. can stll happen if scaling factor isn't constant
		Grads.c: f_ctl_inv prob interval was fixed a2,first,first -> a2,first,second
		set_ftime: all pdts now
		wgrib2/makefile: compile Mod_grib.c with ${FLAGS} instead of ${CFLAGS}, minor fix
		set_date: updated for more PDTs.
		f_code_table_4.11s: added
		-set_ens, so that -1 to be no change
		fix -udf_arg buf[2]
		   want all calls to f_*() to use call_ARGN(buffer, NULL, arg1..argN)
		   if (local == NULL) then call is recursive. must examine code to check local not used!              
		all code: CALL_ARG{N} -> call_ARG{N}
		netcdf/mysql*.c:  f_lev(...) -> f_lev(call_ARG0)
		wgrib2: f_match_inv(..) -> f_match_inv(call_ARG0) f_help -> f_help(call_ARG0)
		added -set table_4.3
		added -Werror=format-security to makefile by suggestion of Orion Poplawski
		modified   sprintf(inv_out, string) to sprintf(inv_out,"%s", string) by Orion Poplawski
		  this changed -ens code 4.7  10 -> 10% 50 -> 50% and 90 -> 90%
		rpn: ln is fixed, popped stack by mistake
		changed wrtieee.c to eliminate warning message about uninitialized hr[4] vector, changes for openmp
		added -Werror=format to makefile
		removed unused variable from geo.c 
		deleted empty file help.c, pot case insen fs prob found J. Taylor
		support for code table 3.20
		better but incomplete support for cross-section grids
		updated gribtab again.  web page copy needs to be edited by hand because Boi is not consistent
		update Grads: f_ctl_inv .. handle pdt == 15
		removed -Werror=format from makefile (jasper would not compile)
		Cyclic.c updated for mercator and thinned grids
		Scan.c removed unused int scatter
		experimental staggered bits support: stagger.c geo.c grb2.h, mk_kgds.c
		removed: int packing_nx() from jpeg_pk.c, optimization that probably never gets used
		added: inv_f77 in Macro.c
		added: new item to match_inv npts=
		added: BUILD_COMMENTS to makefile, Help.c and Config.c and customization comments can add here
			wanted for special hwrf build
		fixed: mk_kgds for grid 203 id mass and wind fields
		updated producedure for making gribtable, add sort and edit, updated gribtable.dat
		updated complex_pk.c static int find_nbits(int i) -> static int find_nbits(unsigned int i)
		    minor speed ups, cleanup
		Earth.c  added code table 9. set_radius now handles user defined radius, major minor axes
		int8.c best_scaled_value() uses maximum scaled value < INT_MAX
		Netcdf.c  Fixed latlon grid longitudes.  COARDS wants longitude to be
		   monotonic and left longitude can be any value. However, Some codes will not
		   will not handle a left longitude of 180.5 but will work with -175.5.
		   So left longitude is set to [-180,180) and longitudes are monotonic.
		   Problem found by K. Havener who also did the testing.
		complex_pk: added nstruct (instead of ndata) for malloc of list and list_backup, save RAM

		stagger.c - added x[] and y[] args to stagger(), altered geo.c and wgrib2.h
		added support for staggered grids
		added set_ival
		updated set_ival to support a list of pointsZ
		complex_pk.c free(u) early, reduce footprint by 4*ndata bytes
		int8.c best_scaled_value() increases scaling (giving more precision) as long as 
                   val-floor(val) != 0 and val/10 < INT_MAX, this means val=1000 is kept as 1000.
		   NOTE: the scaling factor and scaled value changes from previous versions of wgrib2
		   NOTE: the scaled level1 and level2 have changed .. more precision
		gribtable: two SOILM with two different units kg/m/m and kg/m/m/m, both are deprecated
		   rename SOILM (kg/m/m/m) to SOIL_M, so grib1 and grib2 tables are the same
		   it is a deviation from NCO tables but NCO hasn't made a decision
		   NOTE: SOIL_M is not in NCO tables

		EOF.c: if wgrib2 called with no arguments
			old: eof_bin and eof_string were called
			new: err_bin and err_string are called
		       if f_h is called
			old: eof_bin and eof_string were called
			new: err_bin and err_string are called
		    eof_string, eof_bin are called with mode -2  instead of explicitly
		    err_bin, err_string: not called if no error
		all ffopens are paired with ffclose
		Match.c free memory, make match_count a global variable.
		rd_inventory: split from wgrib.c and put in own file, reads from input rather than stdin
		setup options will get finalized, so to close files
		pdt 4.44 only has 2 octets for forecast time!
                   set_ftime .. forecast time from int -> uint

		setup_user_gribtable.c added fclose(input)
		set_metadata: fixed format of scanf
		cleanup of defined but unused variables (found using cppcheck)
		Scan.c: added parameters to routines, make it callable by f_import_grib()
		added -import_grib
		-fcst_ave, -ave, -wind_dir, -wind_speed, -merge, -ncep_norm : old: picked 
                    up scaling from first record.  Problem when first record was constant field.
		    set use_scaling=0
		-fcst_ave, -ave: replaced undo_scan_order, saved many mallocs/frees
		can now write complex-packed files with bitmaps (for NAM)

			convert to data to integer vector  u[i] = floor((data[i] - ref)*scale + 0.5);
			when using decimal scaling, ref is not quite the min value under all compilation
			options (could be 64-bit register vs 32-bit memory value).  The scaling factor is 
			so large that u[i] could be negative!  Added a step to make sure u[i] is >= 0
