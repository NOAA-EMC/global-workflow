C ABSTRACT: PERFORMS QUALITY CONTROL ON TROPICAL CYCLONE POSITION
C   AND INTENSITY INFORMATION (T. C. VITAL STATISTICS).  CHECKS
C   PERFORMED ARE:  DUPLICATE RECORDS, APPROPRIATE DATE/TIME, PROPER
C   RECORD STRUCTURE (BLANKS IN PROPER PLACE AND NO IMPROPER NON-
C   INTEGER NUMBERS), STORM NAME/ID NUMBER, RECORDS FROM MULTIPLE
C   INSTITUTIONS, SECONDARY VARIABLES (E.G. CENTRAL PRESSURE),
C   STORM POSITION AND DIRECTION/SPEED.  EMPHASIS IS ON INTERNAL
C   CONSISTENCY BETWEEN REPORTED STORM LOCATION AND PRIOR MOTION.

C             UNINITIALIZED VARIABLES THAT WERE CAUSING COMPILER
C             WARNINGS
C 1998-06-05  D.A. KEYSER - FORTRAN 90 AND Y2K COMPLIANT
C 1998-06-18  S.J. LORD   - FORTRAN 90 AND Y2K COMPLIANT (vitfmt.inc)
C 1998-08-16  S.J. LORD   - FORTRAN 90 AND Y2K COMPLIANT (completed)
C 1998-12-14  D. A. KEYSER - Y2K/F90 COMPLIANCE, STREAMLINED CODE;
C 2000-03-03  D. A. KEYSER - CONVERTED TO RUN ON IBM-SP MACHINE
C 2001-02-07  D. A. KEYSER - EXPANDED TEST STORM ID RANGE FROM 90-99
C             TO 80-99 AT REQUEST FOR JIM GROSS AT TPC {NOTE: IF THIS
C             EVER HAS TO BE DONE AGAIN, THE ONLY LINES THAT NEED TO
C             BE CHANGED ARE COMMENTED AS "CHG. TESTID" - ALSO MUST
C             CHANGE PROGRAM bulls_bufrcyc WHICH GENERATES GTS
C             MESSAGES, CHANGE UTILITY PROGRAM trpsfcmv WHICH
C             GENERATES CHARTS FOR THE TROPICS (although technically
C             trpsfcmv reads in q-c'd tcvitals files output by this
C             program and thus they should not have test storms in
C             them), and changes scripts: util/ush/extrkr.sh and
C             ush/relocate_extrkr.sh}
C 2004-06-08  D. A. KEYSER - WHEN INTEGER VALUES ARE DECODED FROM
C             CHARACTER-BASED RECORD VIA INTERNAL READ IN SUBR. DECVAR,
C             IF BYTE IN UNITS DIGIT LOCATION IS ERRONEOUSLY CODED AS
C             BLANK (" "), IT IS REPLACED WITH A "5" IN ORDER TO
C             PREVENT INVALID VALUE FROM BEING RETURNED (I.E., IF
C             "022 " WAS READ, IT WAS DECODED AS "22", IT IS NOW
C             DECODED AS "225" - THIS HAPPENED FOR VALUE OF RADIUS OF
C             LAST CLOSED ISOBAR FOR JTWC RECORDS FROM 13 JULY 2000
C             THROUGH FNMOC FIX ON 26 MAY 2004 - THE VALUE WAS REPLACED
C             BY CLIMATOLOGY BECAUSE IT FAILED A GROSS CHECK, HAD THIS
C             CHANGE BEEN IN PLACE THE DECODED VALUE WOULD HAVE BEEN
C             W/I 0.5 KM OF THE ACTUAL VALUE)
C 2008-07-10  D. A. KEYSER - CORRECTED MEMORY CLOBBERING CONDITION
C             IN SUBR. STIDCK RELATED TO ATTEMPTED STORAGE OF MORE WEST
C             PACIFIC STORM NAMES FROM FILE syndat_stmnames (144) THAN
C             ALLOCATED BY PROGRAM AND IN syndat_stmnames (140), THIS
C             LED TO OVERWRITING OF FIRST FOUR syndat_stmnames STORM
C             NAMES IN ATLANTIC BASIN FOR 2002, 2008, 2014 CYCLE -
C             DISCOVERED BECAUSE 2008 STORM BERTHA (STORM #2 IN
C             ATLANTIC BASIN LIST IN syndat_stmnames) WAS NOT BEING
C             RECOGNIZED AND THUS NOT PROCESSED INTO OUTPUT TCVITALS
C             FILE - CORRECTED BY LIMITING STORAGE OF WEST PACIFIC
C             STORM NAMES TO EXACTLY THE MAXIMUM IN PROGRAM (AND NUMBER
C             IN syndat_stmnames) (CURRENTLY 140), ALSO GENERALIZED
C             CODE TO ENSURE THAT IS WILL NEVER CLOBBER MEMORY READING
C             AND STORING STORM NAMES IN ANY OF THE BASINS EVEN IF THE
C             NUMBER OF STORM NAMES IN syndat_stmnames INCREASE (AS
C             LONG AS THE MAXIMUM VALUE IS .GE. TO THE NUMBER OF STORM
C             NAMES FOR THE BASIN IN FILE syndat_stmnames)
C 2013-03-17  D. C. STOKES - CHANGED SOME LIST DIRECTED OUTPUT TO 
C             FORMATTED TO PREVENT UNNDECSSARY WRAPPING ON WCOSS.
C 2013-03-24  D. C. STOKES - INITIALIZE VARIABLES THAT WERE NOT GETTING
C             SET WHEN THERE ARE NO RECORDS TO PROCESS.
C 2013-10-10  D. C. STOKES - ADDED NON-HYPHNATED CARDINAL NUMBERS IN
C             ORDER TO RECOGNIZE SUCH NAMED STORMS IN BASINS L, E, C, W,
C             AND TO RECOGNIZE NAME CHANGES OF SUCH IN THE OTHER BASINS.
C             ALSO EXTENDED THAT LIST (FROM 36 TO 39).
C

C ABSTRACT: INPUT RECORDS ARE CHECKED FOR MULTIPLE REPORTS ON THE SAME
C           STORM FROM DIFFERENT RSMC'S. THE FOLLOWING ACTIONS ARE
C           TAKEN:
C           1) MULTIPLE STORM REPORTS BY DIFFERENT RSMC'S AT THE SAME
C              TIME ARE REMOVED
C           2) TIME SERIES OF REPORTS ON THE SAME STORM BY DIFFERENT
C              RSMC'S ARE DISCOVERED
C           TO RECONCILE THE ABOVE:
C           1) A COMMON STORM ID IS ASSIGNED
C           2) MULTIPLE REPORTS ARE REMOVED IN FAVOR OF A  SINGLE
C              REPORT WITH THE COMMON STORM ID AND COMBINED
C              (AVERAGED) PARAMETERS IF NECESSARY

C
C ABSTRACT: CHECKS FOR PROPER STORM ID AND NAME FOR ALL RECORDS.
C   AN IMPROPER STORM ID IS GROUNDS FOR REJECTION FOR ALL RECORDS.
C   NAME CHECKING IS DONE FOR THE ATLANTIC AND EAST PACIFIC ONLY.
C   AN IMPROPER BASIN CODE IS ALSO GROUNDS FOR OUTRIGHT REJECTION.
C   AN ATTEMPT AT NAME RECOVERY IS MADE FOR HISTORICAL CASES THAT
C   HAVE BEEN RETIRED, E.G. GILBERT (1988) IN THE ATLANTIC.
C
C PROGRAM HISTORY LOG:
C 1990-11-01  S. LORD
C 1992-03-06  S. LORD REVISED TO INCLUDE STMID/STMNAM CHECK
C 1992-07-10  S. LORD REVISED TO DISMANTLE CONSISTENCY CHECKS IN THE
C             CASE OF NUMBERED DEPRESSIONS
C 1992-09-09  S. LORD ADDED CENTRAL PACIFIC NAMES AND NAME CHECK
C 1992-10-28  S. J. LORD ADDED GREEK ALPHABET STORM NAMES
C 1993-03-31  S. J. LORD IMPLEMENTED READING STORM NAMES FROM EXTERNAL
C             FILE IN STIDCK
C 1993-08-25  S. J. LORD ADDED IUNTCA TO ARGUMENT LIST AND ADDED
C             JTWC STORM ID CHECK (NUMBER SAME, DIFFERENT BASIN)
C 2001-02-07  D. A. KEYSER - EXPANDED TEST STORM ID RANGE FROM 90-99
C             TO 80-99 AT REQUEST FOR JIM GROSS AT TPC
C 2008-07-10  D. A. KEYSER - CORRECTED MEMORY CLOBBERING CONDITION
C             RELATED TO ATTEMPTED STORAGE OF MORE WEST PACIFIC STORM
C             NAMES FROM FILE syndat_stmnames (144) THAN ALLOCATED

C             BECAUSE 2008 STORM BERTHA (STORM #2 IN ATLANTIC BASIN
C             LIST IN syndat_stmnames) WAS NOT BEING RECOGNIZED AND
C             THUS NOT PROCESSED INTO OUTPUT TCVITALS FILE - CORRECTED
C             BY LIMITING STORAGE OF WEST PACIFIC STORM NAMES TO
C             EXACTLY THE MAXIMUM IN PROGRAM (AND NUMBER IN
C             syndat_stmnames) (CURRENTLY 140), ALSO GENERALIZED CODE
C             TO ENSURE THAT IS WILL NEVER CLOBBER MEMORY READING AND
C             STORING STORM NAMES IN ANY OF THE BASINS EVEN IF THE

C             LONG AS THE MAXIMUM VALUE IS .GE. TO THE NUMBER OF STORM
C             NAMES FOR THE BASIN IN FILE syndat_stmnames)
C 2013-10-10  D. C. STOKES - ADDED NON-HYPHNATED CARDINAL NUMBER NAMES

C   PRGMMR: S. LORD          ORG: NP22       DATE: 1990-11-01
C
C ABSTRACT: ERROR RECOVERY FOR PARTIAL DUPLICATE RECORDS.  PARTIAL
C   DUPLICATE RECORDS ARE DEFINED AS THOSE WITH IDENTICAL RSMC, STORM
C   ID & NAME, AND DATE/TIME.  THE ERROR RECOVERY PROCEDURE BEGINS BY
C   TRYING TO FIND A PREVIOUS RECORD FOR THE TARGET RECORD, WHICH IS
C   DEFINED AS THE FIRST OF THE DUPLICATE RECORDS (ALL SUBSEQUENT
C   RECORDS ARE DEFINED AS "DUPLICATES").  THE CURRENT RECORDS ARE
C   SEARCHED FIRST, THEN THE SHORT-TERM HISTORY FILE IS SEARCHED.
C   IF NO PREVIOUS RECORDS ARE FOUND ANYWHERE, THE DEFAULT DECISION IS
C   TO KEEP THE LAST OF THE DUPLICATES, UNDER THE ASSSUMPTION THAT
C   THE DUPLICATE RECORDS ARE UPDATE RECORDS FOR THE SAME STORM.
C   IF A PREVIOUS RECORD IS FOUND, ITS EXTRAPOLATED POSITION IS COMPARED
C   WITH THE TARGET RECORD AND THE DUPLICATE RECORDS.  IF THE TARGET
C   POSITION ERROR IS GREATER THAN THE DUPLICATE POSITION, THE
C   TARGET RECORD IS CONSIDERED ERROREOUS.  IF THE TARGET POSITION ERROR
C   IS LESS THAN THE DUPLICATE POSITION ERROR, THE DUPLICATE POSITION
C   IS CHECKED AGAINST AN EXTRAPOLATED FUTURE POSITION.  IF THAT ERROR
C   IS LESS THAN FOR THE CURRENT POSITION, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE
C   DUPLICATE RECORD HAS A DATE/TIME ERROR.  IF THE DUPLICATE POSITION
C   ERROR IS LARGER FOR THE FUTURE TIME, IT IS ASSUMED THAT THE
C   DUPLICATE RECORD IS AN UPDATE RECORD WHICH SUPERCEDES THE TARGET.
