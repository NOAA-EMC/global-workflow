Creates the ESMF integration weight files to transform from cubed-sphere grids
to comparable (in resolution) global gaussian grids.  

First, compile the program that creates the 'scrip' files for the
global gaussian grids.  For each resolution, two grids are created:
one normal grid and one grid with two extra rows for the N/S poles.
To compile, cd to ./scrip.fd and type 'make.sh'.  Currently, only
compiles/runs on Theia.

Then, run the 'run.theia.ksh' script for the resolution desired.
Script first calls the 'scrip' program, then calls ESMF utility 
'RegridWeightGen' to create the interpolation weight files.

Weight files for the following transforms are created:

C48 => 192x94 and 192x96 gaussian
C96 => 384x192 and 384x194 gaussian
C128 => 512x256 and 512x258 gaussian
C192 => 768x384 and 768x386 gaussian
C384 => 1536x768 and 1536x770 gaussian
C768 => 3072x1536 and 3072x1538 gaussian
C1152 => 4608x2304 and 4608x2406 gaussian
C3072 => 12288x6144 and 12288x6146 gaussian
