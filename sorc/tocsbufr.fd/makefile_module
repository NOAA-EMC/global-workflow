# If it is invoked by the command line
#	make -f makefile
# it will compile the fortran modules indicated by SRCS into the object
# modules indicated by OBJS and produce an executable named a.out.

# If it is invoked by the command line
#	make -f makefile a.out.prof
# it will compile the fortran modules indicated by SRCS into the object
# modules indicated by OBJS and produce an executable which profiles
# named a.out.prof.

# To remove all the objects but leave the executables use the command line

# To remove the source files created by /usr/bin/fmgen and this makefile
# use the command line

# The parameters SRCS and OBJS should not need to be changed.  If, however,
# you need to add a new module add the name of the source module to the
# SRCS parameter and add the name of the resulting object file to the OBJS
# parameter.  The new modules are not limited to fortran, but may be C, YACC,
# LEX, or CAL.  An explicit rule will need to be added for PASCAL modules.
