NEMS Documentation
==================

This website describes the coupling infrastructure and
techniques used in the
[NOAA Environmental Modeling System (NEMS)](http://www.emc.ncep.noaa.gov/index.php?branch=NEMS).
NEMS coupling infrastructure is based on the
[Earth System Modeling Framework (ESMF)](http://www.earthsystemmodeling.org/)
and
[National Unified Operational Prediction Capability (NUOPC)](https://www.earthsystemcog.org/projects/nuopc/)
Layer code and conventions. The software is under active development,
and is incorporating atmosphere, ocean, ice, and wave models. The
coupled system will be used for weather and longer range predictions.

Everything in this doxgen-generated webpage is created from files
within the NEMS repository.  That documentation is versioned with the
code -- every time the code is updated, we update the documentation to
match.  Further information outside this website can be found in links
within the above paragraph, as well as the 
[COG site](https://esgf.esrl.noaa.gov/projects/couplednems/)

\todo Refer to VLAB NEMS page once one exists.
