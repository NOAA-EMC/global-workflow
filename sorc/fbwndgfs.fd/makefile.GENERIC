# it will compile the fortran modules indicated by SRCS into the object

# The parameters SRCS and OBJS should not need to be changed.  If, however,
# you need to add a new module add the name of the source module to the
# SRCS parameter and add the name of the resulting object file to the OBJS
# parameter.  The new modules are not limited to fortran, but may be C, YACC,
# LEX, or CAL.  An explicit rule will need to be added for PASCAL modules.
