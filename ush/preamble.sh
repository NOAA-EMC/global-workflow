# Preamble script to be SOURCED at the beginning of every script. Sets 
#   useful PS4 and optionally turns on set -x and set -eu. Also sets up 
#   crude script timing and provides a postamble that runs on exit.
#
# Syntax:
#   preamble.sh [id]
#   
#   Aruguments:
#     id: Optional identifier string. Use when running the same script 
#           multiple times in the same job (e.g. MPMD)
#
# Input environment variables:
#   TRACE (YES/NO): Whether to echo every command (set -x) [default: "YES"]
#   STRICT (YES/NO): Whether to exit immediately on error or undefined variable
#     (set -eu) [default: "YES"]
#   POSTAMBLE_CMD (empty/set): A command to run at the end of the job
#     [default: empty]
