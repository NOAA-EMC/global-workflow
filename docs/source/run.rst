Run Global Workflow
###################

Here we will show how you can run an experiment using the Global Workflow. The Global workflow is regularly evolving and the underlying UFS-weather-model that it drives can run many different configurations. So this part of the document will be regularly updated. The workflow as it is configured today can be run as forecast only or cycled (forecast+Data Assimilation). Since cycled mode requires a number of Data Assimilation supporting repositories to be checked out, the instructions for the two modes from initial build stage will be slightly different.
