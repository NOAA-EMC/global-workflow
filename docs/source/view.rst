View Experiment output
======================

The output from your run will be found in the ``ROTDIR`` you established. This is also where you placed your initial conditions. Within your ``ROTDIR`` you will have the following directory structure (based on the type of experiment you run):

^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Forecast-only
^^^^^^^^^^^^^

::

   gfs.YYYYMMDD/CC/atmos          <- contains deterministic long forecast gfs inputs/outputs (atmosphere)
   gfs.YYYYMMDD/CC/wave           <- contains deterministic long forecast gfs inputs/outputs (wave)
   logs/                          <- logs for each cycle in the run
   vrfyarch/                      <- contains files related to verification and archival

^^^^^^
Cycled
^^^^^^

::

   enkfgdas.YYYYMMDD/CC/mem###/atmos    <- contains EnKF inputs/outputs for each cycle and each member
   gdas.YYYYMMDD/CC/atmos               <- contains deterministic gdas inputs/outputs (atmosphere)
   gdas.YYYYMMDD/CC/wave                <- contains deterministic gdas inputs/outputs (wave)
   gfs.YYYYMMDD/CC/atmos                <- contains deterministic long forecast gfs inputs/outputs (atmosphere)
   gfs.YYYYMMDD/CC/wave                 <- contains deterministic long forecast gfs inputs/outputs (wave)
   logs/                                <- logs for each cycle in the run
   vrfyarch/                            <- contains files related to verification and archival

Here is an example ``ROTDIR`` for a cycled run as it may look several cycles in (note the archival steps remove older cycle folders as the run progresses):
