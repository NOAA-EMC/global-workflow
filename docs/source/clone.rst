===============================
Clone and build Global Workflow
===============================

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Quick Instructions
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Quick clone/build/link instructions (more detailed instructions below).

.. note::
   Here we are making the assumption that you are using the workflow to run an experiment and so are working from the authoritative repository. If you are using a development branch then follow the instructions in :doc:`development.rst`. Once you do that you can follow the instructions here with the only difference being the repository/fork you are cloning from.

Clone the `global-workflow` and `cd` into the `sorc` directory:

::

   git clone --recursive https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow
   cd global-workflow/sorc

For forecast-only (coupled or uncoupled) build of the components:

::

   ./build_all.sh

For cycled (w/ data assimilation) use the `-g` option during build:

::

   ./build_all.sh -g

For coupled cycling (include new UFSDA) use the `-gu` options during build:

[Currently only available on Hera, Orion, and Hercules]

::

   ./build_all.sh -gu


Build workflow components and link workflow artifacts such as executables, etc.

::

   ./link_workflow.sh


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Clone workflow and component repositories
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

********
Workflow
********

There are several ways to clone repositories from GitHub. Below we describe how to clone the global-workflow using the `https` method.

::

   git clone https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow

Check what you just cloned (by default you will have only the `develop` branch):

::

   cd global-workflow
   git branch
   * develop

You now have a cloned copy of the global-workflow git repository. To checkout a branch or tag in your clone:

::

   git checkout --recurse-submodules BRANCH_NAME

.. note::
   Branch must already exist. If it does not you need to make a new branch using the ``-b`` flag:

::

   git checkout -b BRANCH_NAME

The ``checkout`` command will checkout BRANCH_NAME and switch your clone to that branch. Example:

::

   git checkout --recurse-submodules my_branch
   git branch
   * my_branch
   develop

Using ``--recurse-submodules`` is important to ensure you are updating the component versions to match the branch.

^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Build components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Under the ``/sorc`` folder is a script to build all components called ``build_all.sh``. After checking out the branch you wish to use, run this script to build all components codes:

::

   ./build_all.sh [-a UFS_app][-g][-h][-u][-v]
  -a UFS_app:
    Build a specific UFS app instead of the default
  -g:
    Build GSI
  -h:
    Print this help message and exit
  -j:
    Specify maximum number of build jobs (n)
  -u:
    Build UFS-DA
  -v:
    Execute all build scripts with -v option to turn on verbose where supported

For forecast-only (coupled or uncoupled) build of the components:

::

   ./build_all.sh

For cycled (w/ data assimilation) use the `-g` option during build:

::

   ./build_all.sh -g

For coupled cycling (include new UFSDA) use the `-gu` options during build:

[Currently only available on Hera, Orion, and Hercules]

::

   ./build_all.sh -gu


^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Link components
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

At runtime the global-workflow needs all pieces in place within the main superstructure. To establish this a link script is run to create symlinks from the top level folders down to component files checked out in ``/sorc`` folders.

After running the checkout and build scripts run the link script:

::

   ./link_workflow.sh [-o]

Where:
   ``-o``: Run in operations (NCO) mode. This creates copies instead of using symlinks and is generally only used by NCO during installation into production.
