GFS RELEASE NOTES (GFS.v15.0.0)  -- January 24, 2019


PRELUDE
  	 *NOAA/NWS selected the Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory (GFDL) finite­ volume cubed-sphere (FV3)
	dynamical core as the Weather Service Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS).  The current
	operational GFS, which has a spectral dynamical core, will be replaced by the proposed GFS with FV3
	dynamical core and improved physics parameterizations in January, 2019.  Significant changes have
	been made to both the science and infrastructure of the GFS system.

	*GFS.v15 maintains a horizontal resolution of 13 km, and has 64 levels in the vertical extending
	up to 0.2 hPa.  It uses the same physics package as the current operational GFS except for the
	replacement of Zhao-Carr microphysics with the more advanced GFDL microphysics, improved ozone physics
	and water vapor physics etc. There are also updates to data assimilation techniques, observational
	data usage, post-processing and downstream product generation.  For more details please refer to the PNS
	https://docs.google.com/document/d/112GG7yBDMPmEcrNi1R2ISsoLcivj5WPivSnf9Id_lHw/edit 

	*The current operational GFS.v14 was built upon a vertical directory structure. It contains
 	three independent packages.  The latest versions used in operations are gdas.v14.1.0, gfs.v14.1.2,
 	and global_shared.v14.1.6.

	*GFS.v15 has been reorganized to use a flat directory structure. The three packages in GFS.v14 have
 	been merged together to form a single package. Therefore, there is no direct comparison and one-to-one
 	correspondence between GFS.v14 and GFS.v15.

	*This release note describes the overall changes made to the entire system.
 	More details about changes in science and structure of the data assimilation system are documented in
 	.gfs.v15.0.0/sorc/gsi.fd/doc/Release_Notes.fv3gfs_da.v15.0.0.txt.
 	Details about downstream product generation is documented in Release_Notes.gfs_downstream.v15.0.0.txt.


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

   * NOAA Vlab GIT is used to manage GFS.v15 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v15 implementation need to have
 	permission to clone Vlab gerrit repositories.  So far Wojciech Cencek has been given access to all GFS.v15
 	related git repositories. Please contact Fanglin.Yang@noaa.gov if there is any VLAB access issue and/or
 	the individual code managers listed under item #6) below.  Please follow the following steps to install
 	the package on WCOSS DELL

  	1) cd  $NWROOTp3
	2) mkdir gfs.v15.0.0
	3) cd gfs.v15.0.0
  	4) git clone --recursive gerrit:fv3gfs .
  	5) git checkout q2fy19_nco
  	6) cd sorc
  	7) ./checkout.sh
      	This script extracts the following GFS components from gerrit
      		MODEL -- tag nemsfv3gfs_beta_v1.0.12 		Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
        	GSI -- tag fv3da.v1.0.34       			Mark.Potts@noaa.gov and Michael.Lueken@noaa.gov

       		WAFS -- tag gfs_wafs.v5.0.5         		Yali.Mao@noaa.gov


  	8) ./build_all.sh
     	*This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for each package is written
      	to log files in directory logs. To build an individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.
  	
	9) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell

	* Note: 1) ecflow suite definition and scripts are saved in gfs.v15.0.0/ecflow/ecf
        	2) ncep_post_gtg.v1.0.4 contains restricted GTG (Graphic Turbulence Guidance) code provided by
           	NCAR.  Please do not post the GTG code in any public domain.

PARM/CONFIG CHANGES

 	All JJOBS except for those used by downstream product generation source config files under
 	./gfs.v15.0.0/parm/config to set up job-specific parameters.  config.base is sourced by all
 	JJOBS to set parameters that are common to either all JJOBS or are shared by more than one JJOBS.
 	config.anal is shared by a few analysis steps.

  	Below are the parm (config) files used by each GFS.v15 DA job
  	* JGLOBAL_FORECAST      		- config.base, config.fcst
  	* JGLOBAL_NCEPPOST      		- config.base, config.post

  	* JGDAS_ENKF_POST       		- config.base, config.epos



FIX CHANGES

   *	 All fixed fields used by the system are placed under gfs.v15.0.0/fix, and further categorized
 	based on the type of applications. During the NCO implementation process, fix_am, fix_fv3,
 	fix_orog, fix_verif, and fix_fv3_gmted2010 are copied from EMC's local archives. fix_gsi and
 	wafs are copied from two external repositories.
 	The entire package takes 123GB disk space to install. This ./fix directory alone takes 113GB.

 	fix_am     	-- NEMS GSM fields from GFS.v14 and earlier version.  Some of them are still used for GFS.v15.
 	fix_fv3     	-- new fields, defining FV3 model structure for different resolutions, based on TOPO30 terrain
 	fix_fv3_gmted2010 
			-- new fields, defining FV3 model structure for different resolutions, based on gmted2010 terrain
 	fix_orog       	-- sources of  terrain data
 	fix_gsi        	-- used by data assimilation steps
 	fix_verif      	-- bused by VSDB and MET verifications
 	gdas           	-- used by DA monitoring programs
 	product        	-- used by downstream product generation programs
 	wafs           	-- used by WAFS program

RESOURCE INFORMATION

   * Frequency of run
  	* 6 hourly cycle (00, 06, 12, 18Z) - no change from current operations

   * Commonly used libraries, compiler, and modules are defined in gfs.v15.0.0/modulefiles. For nemsfv3gfs, gsi, upp, wafs
 	they maintain their own module files under gfs.v15.0.0/sorc/(fv3gfs gsi gfs_post global_wafs).fd/modulefiles

   * Data retention time under $COMROOThps for GFS.v15 should be the same as GFS.v14.   GFS.v15 is no longer pushing or
 	extracting data from  $GESROOThps.

   * Disk space:  The current operational GFS.v14 takes about 4.1 TB online COM disk space per cycle, while GFS.v15 will
 	require 10.7TB per cycle.


   * Computational resources and run times: Please refer to
 	https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1Y0MJ9NQ8EC1imQSJsNIMcSa4KkNURpmcGUYHe0t8wfk/edit#gid=48801932

PRE-IMPLEMENTATION TESTING REQUIREMENTS

   * Which production jobs should be tested as part of this implementation?
	* all components of this package need to be tested.  EMC is running a real-time parallel using the same system.  We will work with the SPA to provide initial conditions from this parallel to run the NCO parallel during the implementation process. We will compare results from EMC and NCO parallels to ensure they reproduce each other.


   * Does this change require a 30-day evaluation?
  	* Yes, the entire GFS.v15 package requires a 30-day evaluation


   * Suggested evaluators
  	* Please contact fanglin.yang@noaa.gov and russ.treadon@noaa.gov for evaluation.


DISSEMINATION INFORMATION

   * Where should this output be sent?
  	* same as current operations.


   * Who are the users?
  	* same as current operations


   * Which output files should be transferred from PROD WCOSS to DEV WCOSS?
  	* Same as current operation. As there are certain changes in product names and types,
    	EMC will provide support for NCO dataflow team to finalize the list.

   * Directory changes
  	* Add cycle to gfs and gdas paths.  GFS.v15 paths are $COMROOTp3/gfs/prod/gfs.$PDY/$cyc
    	and  $COMROOTp3/gfs/prod/gdas.$PDY/$cyc.
  	* Add "gdas" to top level EnKF directory --> $COMROOTp3/gfs/prod/enkf.gdas.$PDY.

HPSS ARCHIVE

   HPSS archive: please refer to https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/14YdtuC_bL-6eybLA-rvKVvW1eLD_f6NFWzxnatYyCMo/edit#gid=0 
   for current operational GFS.v14 archives and the proposed archives for GFS.v15.
   Note that we are proposing to restructure GFS HPSS archive and use new tarball names to 
   1) follow GFS.v15 restart file style and, 2) to better serve the needs of different users.
