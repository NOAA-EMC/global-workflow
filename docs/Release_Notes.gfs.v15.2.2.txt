GFS v15.2.0 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE (taken from GFS v15.2.0 SCN)

     GFS version 15.1 was implemented into operation at the 12Z cycle on June 12, 2019.  It was the first 
     GFS implementation with the finite­ volume cubed-sphere (FV3) dynamical core as the Weather Service’s 
     Next Generation Global Prediction System (NGGPS).

     GFS version 15.2 is a minor upgrade. The major change to the system is to ingest new and replacement 
     satellite observations for data assimilation.  It also contains a few other minor upgrades and bug fixes.  

     1) Assimilate new satellite observations
       * GOES-17 AMVs
          * GOES-17 has already replaced GOES-15 as the operational GOES-West satellite.   Distribution of 
            GOES-15 products is expected to cease around December 2019 and active assimilation of GOES-17 
            AMVs is required to prevent a gap in data coverage.
       * Metop-C AMSU and MHS
          * Metop-C is now the primary satellite in the 9:30 AM orbit.  Assimilation of these data provide 
            additional impact as well as adding robustness to the system.
       * KOMPSAT-5 (GPS-RO)
          * Provides additional robustness to the system.
       * Addition changes are made to VIIRS AMV ingest code to allow continued use after an expected change 
         to the BUFR format.

     2) Assimilate buoyb sea-surface temperature (SST) data
        TAC2BUFR changes in the buoy network resulted in a reduction of available SST measurements from buoys
        to 10% or less of expected levels. Obsproc and GSI changes were required to restore data counts to 
        previous levels.

     3) New product: Graphical Turbulence Guidance (GTG) 
        Global Turbulence product generated using NCAR GTG algorithm will start being disseminated on NOMADS. 
        The product will be available 3 hourly from F06 to F36 and horizontal resolution will be a quarter 
        degree. gfs.t{CC}Z.gtg.0p25.grb2f{HHH}

     4) Update the Unified Post Processor(UPP) to address a mask issue of several land surface fields over 
        water bodies in grib2 products.     

        This update will make GFS.v15.2 p-grid products to be more consistent with GFS.v14 products, and 
        remove spurious soil moisture along coastlines.  These land surface fields include Soil Moisture, 
        Soil Temperature, Liquid Volumetric Soil Moisture, WEASD, Snow Depth, Water Runoff,  GFLUX Ground 
        Heat Flux, WILT Wilting Point, and FLDCP Field Capacity.

        Affected product files are:
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2.0p25.F{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2b.0p25.g{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2.0p50.F{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2b.0p50.g{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2.1p00.F{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.pgrb2b.1p00.g{HHH}
          gfs.t{CC}Z.sfluxgrbf{HHH}.grib2
        Where CC is cycle for 00, 06, 12, 18 UTC, and HHH is forecast hour.

     5) The vessel icing program uses OISST as input. OISST will not be ported from WCOSS Phase 1 to Phase 3
        after Phase 1 is decommissioned in 2020.  A decision was made to move the vessel icing program 
        within the Unified Post Processor(UPP) and use GFS forecast skin temperature as input.  Current vessel 
        icing product in operation (sice.tCCz.siceg) has a 1-deg resolution and is disseminated to the public at 

        ftp://ftp.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/omb/prod/sice.yyyymmdd/

        New vessel icing product will be included as a variable (ICEG) in GFS p-grid products gfs.tCCz.pgrb2.xpxx.fxxx
        and gfs.tCCz.pgrb2b.xpxx.fxxx at 0.25, 0.5, and 1.0-deg resolutions, and be disseminated to the public at 

        ftp://ftp.ncep.noaa.gov/pub/data/nccf/com/gfs/prod/gfs.yyyymmdd/

     6) Added three stations to station time series bufr soundings:

        006011 62.02N   6.76W TOR  00 Thorshvan, Denmark    54 Usr Rqst 4-19
        999913 15.51S 128.15E WYN  00 Wyndham aerodrome Australia 4 Usr Rqst 1-19
        999914 57.48N   7.36W EGPL 00 Benbecula, Scotland, UK  6 Usr Rqst 1-19
  
        The affected output files are:
          gfs_yyyymmddhh.sfc
          gfs_yyyymmddhh.snd
          gfs.tCCz.bufrsnd.tar.gz
  
        Three additional files for the stations:
          bufr.006011.yyyymmddhh
          bufr.999913.yyyymmddhh
          bufr.999914.yyyymmddhh 

     7) Reduction of water temperature biases in small lakes.
        For small lakes adequate observations do not always exit to support the analysis of lake surface 
        temperature, often leading to significant departures from both the climatology and real-time observation.
        Two changes were introduced to ensure that lake temperatures do not deviate from the climatology when 
        observations are not available. The first change is to replace a surface mask file at 0.5-degree 
        resolution with the one on the T1534 Gaussian grid (~13km) to prevent unrealistic SST climatology 
        from being used for updating the background of the near sea-surface temperature analysis over small 
        water bodies, such as those in the Great Salt Lake. The second change is to reduce the relaxation 
        time scale of the SST to climatology in GDAS forecast step from 90 days to 10 days.    
    
     8) Changes to NOAAPORT/SBN 
        Product Removals
          * GADS FAX product which contains tropical surface analysis in TIF format with G4 compression.



IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

   * NOAA Vlab GIT is used to manage GFS.v15.2 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v15.2 implementation need to have
 	permission to clone Vlab gerrit repositories.  So far Wojciech Cencek has been given access to all GFS.v15.2
 	related git repositories. Please contact Kate.Friedman@noaa.gov or Hang.Lei@noaa.gov if there is any VLAB 
        access issue and/or the individual code managers listed under item #6) below.  Please follow the following 
        steps to install the package on WCOSS DELL

  	1) cd  $NWROOTp3
	2) mkdir gfs.v15.2.0
