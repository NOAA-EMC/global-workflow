GFS V16.1.4 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE

  NOAA awarded Delivery Order 3 (DO-3) of its commercial radio occultation
  (RO) data purchase to Spire Global on August 12, 2021.  This purchase
  covers 3000 occultations per day over a six month period with the data
  flow starting on September 16, 2021.  On the same date, the GeoOptics
  data from Delivery Order 2 (DO-2) will be discontinued.

  GNSSRO bending angle observations from GeoOptics and Spire were initially
  evaluated as part of Delivery Order 1 (DO-1), covering a 30-day period
  starting on December 15, 2020.  The data from both vendors were found to
  be of similar quality to other operationally assimilated RO data.  Low
  resolution experiments informed the configuration of the quality control
  and observation errors for the following DO-2, which was awarded to
  GeoOptics only, covering an average of 1300 occultations per day over a
  six month period starting on March 17, 2021.  These data began to be
  assimilated operationally with the implementation of GFSv16.1.1 on
  May 22, 2021 after two months of parallel testing at full resolution.

  Following the v16.1.1 implementation, the observation errors for
  commercial RO were tuned to better utilize the new data.  Additionally,
  two fixes related to the handling of super-refractivity in the RO bending
  angle observation operator were added.  These fixes resolve minimization
  issues that were related to the increased vertical resolution in v16.
  Therefore, the stricter gross check quality control measures originally
  put in place to mitigate minimization problems will now be relaxed.

  This implementation plans to:
    * Turn off the active assimilation of GeoOptics data
    * Turn on the active assimilation of Spire data
    * Adjust the observation errors for the Spire data
    * Address two issues within the RO bending angle observation operator
    * Relax the strict gross check added because of those issues.

  These changes only affect two files within the GSI tag of the global workflow.

  In addition, a small bug fix is required to correct the ingest of new BUFR
  observations from ships that was previously causing erroneous observations
  to be assimilated.  This alters one additional file in the GSI tag.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

  The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com
  are used to manage the GFS.v16.1.4 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1.4
  implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and
  the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository. All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are
  publicly readable and do not require access permissions.  Please follow the
  following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell:

  1) cd $NWROOTp3

  2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.4

  3) cd gfs.v16.1.4

  4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.4  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .

  5) cd sorc

  6) ./checkout.sh -o
     * This script extracts the following GFS components:
         MODEL     tag GFS.v16.0.16                  Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
         GSI       tag gfsda.v16.1.4                 Russ.Treadon@noaa.gov
         GLDAS     tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0  Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
         UFS_UTILS tag ops-gfsv16.0.0                George.Gayno@noaa.gov
         POST      tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.4     Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
         WAFS      tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.22              Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

  7) ./build_all.sh
     * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for
       each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an
       individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.

  8) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell
