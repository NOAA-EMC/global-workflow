GFS V16.1.6 RELEASE NOTES


PRELUDE

  NOAA awarded Delivery Order 4 (DO-4) of its commercial radio occultation (RO)
  data purchase to both Spire Global and GeoOptics on February 10, 2022.  This
  purchase covers 5500 occultations per day from Spire and 500 occultations per
  day from GeoOptics over a 10 month period with the data flow starting on
  March 16, 2022.

  Both GeoOptics and Spire have been assimilated in operations as part of
  previous delivery orders.  DO-1 was awarded to both vendors, but was used
  for evaluation purposes only and not assimilated operationally.  DO-2 was
  awarded to GeoOptics and subsequently assimilated in the operational GFS/GDAS
  as v16.1.  DO-3 was then awarded to Spire only.  The v16.1.4 implementation
  turned on the assimilation of Spire data as well as turned off the assimilation
  of GeoOptics.

  If no changes are made to operations, we will assimilate the Spire portion of
  the purchase, but would not assimilate the new GeoOptics data. In order to
  assimilate data from both vendors, a single line change in the global_convinfo.txt
  fix file is required.  There are no other changes planned for this implementation.
  Once data flow begins on March 16th, a one-week evaluation of the new GeoOptics
  observations is needed before implementation.

  In addition to DO-4, a small change is needed to accompany a change in the
  observation processing.  Winds "NeXRaD VAD WINDS FROM LEVEL 2 DECODER"
  (tank b002/xx017) will soon be included in the global observation processing.
  Since these observations have not yet been evaluated in the GFS, this observation
  type (uv 224) will be set to monitor mode.  This requires a single line change
  in the global_convinfo.txt file.


IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

  The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com
  are used to manage the GFS.v16.1.6 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1.6
  implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and
  the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository. All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are
  publicly readable and do not require access permissions.  Please follow the
  following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell:

  1) cd $NWROOTp3

  2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.6

  3) cd gfs.v16.1.6

  4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.6.2  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .

  5) cd sorc

  6) ./checkout.sh -o
     * This script extracts the following GFS components:
         MODEL     tag GFS.v16.0.17                  Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
         GSI       tag gfsda.v16.1.6                 Catherine.Thomas@noaa.gov
         GLDAS     tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0  Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
         UFS_UTILS tag ops-gfsv16.0.0                George.Gayno@noaa.gov
         POST      tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.4     Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
         WAFS      tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.22              Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

  7) ./build_all.sh
     * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for
       each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an
       individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.

  8) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell
