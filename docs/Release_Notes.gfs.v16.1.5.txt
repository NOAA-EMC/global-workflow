GFS V16.1.5 RELEASE NOTES
  
PRELUDE
 
Metop-A, B and C all have similar orbits. Metop-C was launched on 7 November 2018 in a low-Earth polar orbit while Metop-A was launched in 2006. The Metop-A will be decommissioned in November 2021 and IASI_Metop-A data quality has degraded since September 17, so the assimilation of IASI_Metop-A was stopped on 9/22/2021 gfs.v16.1.3 implementation. The IASI_Metop-C data have similar quality as IASI_Metop-B. This implementation will start to assimilate IASI data on Metop-C. In addition, the correlated observation errors for hyperspectral Infrared instruments both IASI and CrIS were recomputed from recent operations, which should be a more accurate representation of the observation error statistics. Both low- and high-resolution parallel experiments show reasonable results as expected.

In addition, a minimum value was set in gsi source code genqsat.f90 to limit the saturation specific humidity not smaller than 1.e-7, which is a risk mitigation feature and could avoid the potential risk of generating unphysical temperature in the analysis.

This implementation plans to:

* Turn on the active assimilation of Metop-C IASI data with correlated observation errors
* Update correlated observation errors for Metop-B IASI, N20 CrIS, and NPP CrIS
* Put in a minimum threshold for saturation specific humidity to avoid potential minimization issues.

These changes affect one source code and several fix files within the GSI tag of the global workflow.

Also bundled into this update are the new 2022 CO2 fix files (see files listed below) and a new FV3 model tag that adds traceback flags to compilation by default. The CO2 fix files will be included during the link setup step. Neither the CO2 fix file nor the FV3 tag updates impact model results.

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS
 
The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com are used to manage the GFS.v16.1.5 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1.5 implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository (the “nwprod” account has access to the GTG repository). All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are publicly readable and do not require access permissions. Please follow the following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell.
 
While logged in under the “nwprod” account:

1) cd $NWROOTp3
2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.5
3) cd gfs.v16.1.5
4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.5  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .
5) cd sorc
6) ./checkout.sh -o
   * This script extracts the following GFS components:
     MODEL      tag GFS.v16.0.17			Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
     GSI        tag gfsda.v16.1.5   	    		Russ.Treadon@noaa.gov
     GLDAS     	tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0     	Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
     UFS_UTILS 	tag ops-gfsv16.0.0  	               	George.Gayno@noaa.gov
     POST       tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.4        	Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
     WAFS       tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.22                  	Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

7) ./build_all.sh
   * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.
8) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell  

SORC CHANGES

* checkout.sh will checkout the following changed model tags:
  * MODEL tag GFS.v16.0.17
    * conf/configure.fv3.wcoss_dell_p3 and other platform configure.fv3 files: add “-g -traceback” to FFLAGS_OPT, CFLAGS_OPT, and CFLAGS_REPRO compilation settings
  * GSI tag gfsda.v16.1.5
    * src/gsi/genqsat.f90: add a lower bound of qsat to avoid unphysical saturation specific humidity to be generated.
