GFS V16.1.8 RELEASE NOTES

PRELUDE

Meteosat-9 replaces Meteosat-8 as the operational geostationary platform over the Indian Ocean on 20220601.  To maintain continuity of operations, the /fix/fix_gsi/global_convinfo.txt file needs to be modified before this date (as soon as possible is preferable)

IMPLEMENTATION INSTRUCTIONS

  The NOAA VLab and both the NOAA-EMC and NCAR organization spaces on GitHub.com
  are used to manage the GFS.v16.1.8 code. The SPA(s) handling the GFS.v16.1.8
  implementation need to have permissions to clone VLab gerrit repositories and
  the private NCAR UPP_GTG repository. All NOAA-EMC organization repositories are
  publicly readable and do not require access permissions.  Please follow the
  following steps to install the package on WCOSS-Dell:

  1) cd $NWROOTp3

  2) mkdir gfs.v16.1.8

  3) cd gfs.v16.1.8

  4) git clone -b EMC-v16.1.8  https://github.com/NOAA-EMC/global-workflow.git .

  5) cd sorc

  6) ./checkout.sh -o
      * This script extracts the following GFS components:
	MODEL 	   tag GFS.v16.0.17              	Jun.Wang@noaa.gov
	GSI   	   tag gfsda.v16.1.8             	Catherine.Thomas@noaa.gov
	GLDAS 	   tag gldas_gfsv16_release.v1.12.0	Helin.Wei@noaa.gov
	UFS_UTILS  tag ops-gfsv16.0.0            	George.Gayno@noaa.gov
	POST  	   tag upp_gfsv16_release.v1.1.4 	Wen.Meng@noaa.gov
	WAFS  	   tag gfs_wafs.v6.0.22          	Yali.Mao@noaa.gov

  7) ./build_all.sh
      * This script compiles all GFS components. Runtime output from the build for
	each package is written to log files in directory logs. To build an
	individual program, for instance, gsi, use build_gsi.sh.

  8) ./link_fv3gfs.sh nco dell
